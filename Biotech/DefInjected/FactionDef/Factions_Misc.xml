  <!-- EN: A loose union of hardy pigskin townships. They're willing to make friends, even with thinsnouts, but they're also ready to toss a bomb and gnaw human gristle when it suits them. Treat them with respect and they'll offer a trotter to an ally in need. Turn against them and the last thing you hear might be a triumphant battle squeal. -->

  <PirateWaster.label>пірати сміттярі</PirateWaster.label>
  <!-- EN: A loose collection of violent pirate bands made up primarily of wasters - xenohumans engineered to thrive around toxins and pollution. They have little interest in building, or farming, preferring to take their sustenance from others using violence.\n\nTheir technology level depends mostly on who they've managed to steal from recently. Mostly they carry gunpowder weapons, though some prefer to stab victims at close range. -->
  <PirateWaster.description>Неорганізована група жорстоких піратських банд, що складаються переважно зі сміттярів - ксенолюдей, створених для процвітання в умовах токсинів і забруднення. Вони мало зацікавлені в будівництві або сільському господарстві, вважаючи за краще забирати їжу в інших, використовуючи насильство.\n\nЇх технологічний рівень залежить в основному від того, кого вони зуміли обікрасти недавно. Здебільшого вони носять порохову зброю, хоча деякі вважають за краще колоти жертв з близької відстані.</PirateWaster.description>
